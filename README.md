This is the POC project to show two different pages on the same URL, Basically this is useful when you do not want to change the URL but still wants to show marketing page or a teaser page to show case what is coming in the future for this site, while still old web site routes will work as is, To understand more i have put a blog on https://daivagnananavati.blogspot.com/2025/10/sitecore-how-to-show-new-marketing.html
